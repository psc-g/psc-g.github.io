behind the loss of expressivity during the training of RL
agents. The observed decrease in the learning ability over
time raises the following question: <em>Do RL agents use neural
network parameters to their full potential?</em> To answer this,
we analyze neuron activity throughout training and track <em>dormant neurons</em>: neurons that have become practically inactive
through low activations. Our analyses reveal that the number of dormant neurons increases as training progresses, an
effect we coin the &ldquo;<em>dormant neuron phenomenon</em>&rdquo;. Specifically, we find that while agents start the training with a
small number of dormant neurons, this number increases as
training progresses. The effect is exacerbated by the number
of gradient updates taken per data collection step. This is
in contrast with supervised learning, where the number of
dormant neurons remains low throughout training.</p><p>We demonstrate the presence of the dormant neuron phenomenon across different algorithms and domains.
To address this issue, we propose Recycling Dormant neurons (<em>ReDo</em>), a simple and effective method to avoid network
under-utilization during training without sacrificing previously learned knowledge: we explicitly limit the spread
of dormant neurons by &ldquo;recycling&rdquo; them to an active state.
<em>ReDo</em> consistently maintains the capacity of the network
throughout training and improves the agent’s performance
(see figure above).</p><h2 id=background>Background</h2><p>See <a href=/posts/mentoring/intro-to-rl/>this post</a> for a background on reinforcement learning. Some extra background not
covered in that post follows.</p><p>The number of gradient updates performed per environment
step is known as the <em>replay ratio</em>. This is a key design choice
that has a substantial impact on performance. Increasing the replay ratio can increase the
sample-efficiency of RL agents as more parameter updates
per sampled trajectory are performed. However, prior works
have shown that training agents with a high replay ratio can
cause training instabilities, ultimately resulting in decreased
agent performance <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07802>(Nikishin et al., 2022)</a>.</p><p>One important aspect of reinforcement learning, when contrasted with supervised learning, is that RL agents train on
highly non-stationary data, where the non-stationarity is
coming in a few forms, but we focus on two of the most salient ones.</p><p><strong>Input data non-stationarity:</strong> The data the agent trains on
is collected in an online manner by interacting with the environment using its current policy $\pi$; this data is then used
to update the policy, which affects the distribution of future samples.</p><p><strong>Target non-stationarity:</strong> The learning target used by RL
agents is based on its own estimate $Q_{\tilde{\theta}}$, which is changing
as learning progresses.</p><h2 id=the-dormant-neuron-phenomenon>The Dormant Neuron Phenomenon</h2><blockquote><p><strong>Definition</strong></p><blockquote><p>Given an input distribution $D$, let $h^\ell_i(x)$
denote the activation of neuron $i$ in layer $\ell$ under input
$x\in D$ and $H^\ell$ be the number of neurons in layer $\ell$. We
define the score of a neuron $i$ (in layer $\ell$) via the normalized
average of its activation as follows:
$$ s^{\ell}_i = \frac{\mathbb{E}_{x\in D} |h^{\ell}_i(x)|}{\frac{1}{H^{\ell}}\sum_{k\in h}\mathbb{E}_{x\in D}|h^{\ell}_k(x)|} $$
We say a neuron $i$ in layer $\ell$ is <strong>$\tau$-dormant</strong> if $s^{\ell}_i \leq \tau$.</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>We normalize the scores such that they sum to 1 within a
layer. This makes the comparison of neurons in different
layers possible.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Definition</strong></p><blockquote><p>An algorithm exhibits the <strong>dormant neuron
phenomenon</strong> if the number of $|tau$-dormant neurons in its
neural network increases steadily throughout training.</p></blockquote></blockquote><h3 id=present-in-deep-rl-agents>Present in deep RL agents</h3><p>We begin our analyses by tracking the number
of dormant neurons during DQN training. In the figure below, we
observe that the percentage of dormant neurons steadily
increases throughout training. This observation is consistent
across different algorithms and environments.</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/redo/figure2.png alt="Dormant neurons increase" width=90% class=center><h3 id=exacerbated-by-target-non-stationarity>Exacerbated by target non-stationarity</h3><p>We hypothesize that the non-stationarity of training deep
RL agents is one of the causes for the dormant neuron
phenomenon. To evaluate this hypothesis, we consider two
supervised learning scenarios using the standard CIFAR-10
dataset: (1) training a network with <em>fixed targets</em>, and
(2) training a network with <em>non-stationary targets</em>, where
the labels are shuffled throughout training. As the figure
below shows, the number
of dormant neurons <em>decreases</em> over time with fixed targets,
but <em>increases</em> over time with non-stationary targets. Indeed,
the sharp increases in the figure correspond to the points
in training when the labels are shuffled. These findings
suggest that the continuously changing targets in deep RL
are a significant factor for the presence of the phenomenon.</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/redo/figure3.png alt="Made worse by target non-stationarity" width=50% class=center><h3 id=input-non-stationarity-not-a-major-factor>Input non-stationarity not a major factor</h3><p>To investigate whether the non-stationarity due
to online data collection plays a role in exacerbating the
phenomenon, we measure the number of dormant neurons
in the offline RL setting, where an agent is trained on a
fixed dataset. In the figure below we can see that the phenomenon remains in this setting, suggesting that input non-stationary
is not one of the primary contributing factors. To further
analyze the source of dormant neurons in this setting, we
train RL agents with fixed random targets (ablating the nonstationarity in inputs and targets). The decrease in the number
of dormant neurons observed in this case
supports our hypothesis that target non-stationarity in RL
training is the primary source of the dormant neuron phenomenon.</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/redo/figure4.png alt="Offline RL" width=90% class=center><h3 id=dormant-neurons-remain-dormant>Dormant neurons remain dormant</h3><p>To investigate
whether dormant neurons &ldquo;reactivate&rdquo; as training progresses,
we track the overlap in the set of dormant neurons. The figure below
plots the overlap coefficient between the set of dormant neurons in the penultimate layer at the current iteration, and
the historical set of dormant neurons. The increase shown
in the figure strongly suggests that once a neuron becomes
dormant, it remains that way for the rest of training.</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/redo/figure5.png alt="Overlap coefficient" width=90% class=center><p>To further investigate this, we explicitly prune any neuron found
dormant throughout training, to check whether their removal
affects the agent’s overall performance. As the figure below shows,
their removal does not affect the agent’s performance, further confirming that dormant neurons remain dormant.</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/redo/figure6.png alt="Pruning dormant neurons" width=90% class=center><h3 id=made-worse-by-more-gradient-updates>Made worse by more gradient updates</h3><p>Although an increase in replay ratio can seem appealing
from a data-efficiency point of view (as more gradient updates per environment step are taken), it has been shown to
cause overfitting and performance collapse. In the figure below we measure neuron
dormancy while varying the replay ratio, and observe
a strong correlation between replay ratio and the fraction
of neurons turning dormant. Although difficult to assert
conclusively, this finding could account for the difficulty in
training RL agents with higher replay ratios.</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/redo/figure7.png alt="Varying replay ratios" width=90% class=center><h3 id=new-tasks-are-more-difficult>New tasks are more difficult</h3><p>We directly examine the effect of dormant neurons
on an RL network’s ability to learn new tasks. To do so,
we train a DQN agent with a replay ratio of 1 (this agent
exhibits a high level of dormant neurons as observed in
the figure above). Next we fine-tune this network by distilling it
towards a well performing DQN agent’s network, using a
traditional regression loss and compare this with a randomly
initialized agent trained using the same loss. In the figure below we
see that the pre-trained network, which starts with a high
level of dormant neurons, shows degrading performance
throughout training; in contrast, the randomly initialized
baseline is able to continuously improve. Further, while
the baseline network maintains a stable level of dormant
neurons, the number of dormant neurons in the pre-trained
network continues to increase throughout training.</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/redo/figure8.png alt="Pretrained networks" width=90% class=center><h2 id=recycling-dormant-neurons-redo>Recycling Dormant Neurons (ReDo)</h2><p>We propose to <em>re</em>cycle <em>do</em>rmant neurons periodically during training (<em>ReDo</em>).
The main idea of ReDo, outlined in the algorithm below, is rather
simple: during regular training, periodically check in all
layers whether any neurons are $\tau$-dormant; for these, reinitialize their incoming weights and zero out the outgoing
weights. The incoming weights are initialized using the
original weight distribution. Note that if $\tau$ is 0, we are effectively leaving the network’s output unchanged; if $\tau$ is small,
the output of the network is only slightly changed.</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/redo/algorithm.png alt="ReDo algorithm" width=50% class=center><p>The figure below showcases the effectiveness of ReDo in dramatically reducing the number of dormant neurons, which also
results in improved agent performance.</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/redo/figure9.png alt="ReDo effect" width=90% class=center><h2 id=empirical-evaluations>Empirical evaluations</h2><p>We evaluate DQN on 17 games from the Arcade Learning Environment. We study two
different architectures: the default CNN used by the original DQN paper,
and the ResNet architecture used by the IMPALA agent.
Additionally, we evaluate DrQ($\epsilon$) on the 26 games used in the Atari 100K
benchmark, and SAC on four MuJoCo environments.</p><p>All our experiments and implementations were conducted using the
<a href=https://github.com/google/dopamine>Dopamine framework</a>.
For agents trained with ReDo, we use
a threshold of $\tau = 0.1$, unless otherwise noted, as we found
this gave a better performance than using a threshold of 0
or 0.025. When aggregating results across multiple games,
we report the Interquantile Mean (IQM) using 5 independent seeds for each
DQN experiment, 10 for the DrQ and SAC experiments,
and reporting 95% stratified bootstrap confidence intervals.</p><h3 id=sample-efficiency>Sample efficiency</h3><p>Motivated by our finding that higher replay ratios exacerbate
dormant neurons and lead to poor performance,
we investigate whether ReDo can help mitigate these. To
do so, we report the IQM for four replay ratio values: 0.25
(default for DQN), 0.5, 1, and 2 when training with and
without ReDo. Since increasing the replay ratio increases
the training time and cost, we train DQN for 10M frames,
as opposed to the regular 200M. As the figure below demonstrates, ReDo is able to avoid the performance
collapse when increasing replay ratios, and even to benefit
from the higher replay ratios when trained with ReDo.</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/redo/figure10a.png alt="Replay ratio on DQN" width=50% class=center><p>In the figure below we added $n$-step returns with a value of $n = 3$.
While this change results in a
general improvement in DQN’s performance, it still suffers
from performance collapse with higher replay ratios; ReDo
mitigates this and improves performance across all values.</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/redo/figure10b.png alt="Replay ratio on DQN with n-step" width=50% class=center><p>To evaluate ReDo’s impact on
different network architectures, in the figure below
we replace the default CNN architecture used by
DQN with the ResNet architecture used by the IMPALA
agent. We see a similar trend: ReDo
enables the agent to make better use of higher replay ratios,
resulting in improved performance.</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/redo/figure10c.png alt="Replay ratio with Impala" width=50% class=center><p>We evaluate on a sample-efficient valuebased agent DrQ($\epsilon$) on the Atari 100K benchmark in the figure below.
In this setting, we train for 400K steps, where
we can see the effect of dormant neurons on performance,
and study the following replay ratio values: 1 (default),
2, 4, 8. Once again, we observe ReDo’s effectiveness in
improving performance at higher replay ratios.</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/redo/figure10d.png alt="Replay ratio with DrQ" width=50% class=center><h3 id=over-parameterization-is-not-enough>Over-parameterization is not enough</h3><p>To investigate whether over-parameterization can mitigate the dormant
neuron phenomenon, we increase the size of the DQN network
by doubling and quadrupling the width of its layers (both
the convolutional and fully connected). The left plot in
Figure 12 shows that larger networks have at most a mild
positive effect on the performance of DQN, and the resulting performance is still far inferior to that obtained when
using ReDo with the default width. Furthermore, training
with ReDo seems to improve as the network size increases,
suggesting that the agent is able to better exploit network
parameters, compared to when training without ReDo.</p><p>An interesting finding in the figure below is that
the percentage of dormant neurons is similar across the
varying widths. As expected, the use of ReDo dramatically
reduces this number for all values.</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/redo/figure12.png alt="Varying widths" width=90% class=center><h3 id=comparison-to-other-methods>Comparison to other methods</h3><p>Nikishin et al. (2022) also observed performance collapse
when increasing the replay ratio, but attributed this to overfitting to early samples (an effect they refer to as the &ldquo;primacy
bias&rdquo;). To mitigate this, they proposed periodically resetting
the network, which can be seen as a form of regularization.
We compare the performance of ReDo against theirs, which
periodically resets only the penultimate layer for Atari environments. Additionally, we compare to adding weight
decay, as this is a simpler, but related, form of regularization. It is worth highlighting that Nikishin et al. (2022)
also found high values of replay ratio to be more amenable
to their method. As the figure below illustrates, weight decay is
comparable to periodic resets, but ReDo is superior to both.</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/redo/figure13.png alt="Comparison to other methods" width=90% class=center><p>We continue our comparison with resets and weight decay
on two MuJoCo environments with the SAC agent. As the figure below shows, ReDo is the only method
that does not suffer a performance degradation.</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/redo/figure14.png alt="Comparison to other methods in MuJoCo" width=90% class=center><h2 id=discussion-and-conclusion>Discussion and Conclusion</h2><p>In this work we identified the dormant neuron phenomenon
whereby, during training, an RL agent’s neural network
exhibits an increase in the number of neurons with littleor-no activation. We demonstrated that this phenomenon
is present across a variety of algorithms and domains, and
provided evidence that it does result in reduced expressivity
and inability to adapt to new tasks.</p><p>Interestingly, studies in neuroscience have found similar
types of dormant neurons (precursors) in the adult brain of
several mammalian species, including humans, albeit with different dynamics.
Certain brain neurons start off as dormant during embryonic
development, and progressively awaken with age, eventually
becoming mature and functionally integrated as excitatory
neurons. Contrastingly, the
dormant neurons we investigate here emerge over time and
exacerbate with more gradient updates.</p><p>To overcome this issue, we proposed a simple method
(ReDo) to maintain network utilization throughout training
by periodic recycling of dormant neurons. The simplicity of ReDo allows for easy integration with existing RL
algorithms. Our experiments suggest that this can lead to improved performance. Indeed, our results
suggest that ReDo can be an important component in being
able to successfully scale RL networks in a sample-efficient
manner.</p><h3 id=limitations-and-future-work>Limitations and future work</h3><p>Although the simple approach of recycling neurons we introduced yielded good
results, it is possible that better approaches exist. For example, ReDo reduces dormant neurons significantly but it
doesn’t completely eliminate them. Further research on
initialization and optimization of the recycled capacity can
address this and lead to improved performance. Additionally, the dormancy threshold is a hyperparameter that
requires tuning; having an adaptive threshold over the course
of training could improve performance even further. Finally, further investigation into the relationship between
the task’s complexity, network capacity, and the dormant
neuron phenomenon would provide a more comprehensive
understanding.</p><p>This work suggests there are important gains to be had by investigating the
network architectures and topologies used for deep reinforcement learning.
Moreover, the observed network’s behavior during training (i.e. the change in
the network capacity utilization), which differs from supervised learning,
indicates a need to explore optimization techniques specific to reinforcement
