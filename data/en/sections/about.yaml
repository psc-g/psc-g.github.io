# a summary about you
summary: 'I was born and raised in Quito, Ecuador, and moved to Montreal after high school to study at McGill. I stayed in Montreal for the next 10 years, finished my bachelors, worked at a flight simulator company, and then eventually obtained my masters and PhD at McGill, focusing on Reinforcement Learning under the supervision of Doina Precup and Prakash Panangaden. After my PhD I did a 10-month postdoc in Paris before moving to Pittsburgh to join Google. I have worked at Google since 2012, and am currently a staff research scientist in Google DeepMind in Montreal, focusing on fundamental Reinforcement Learning research, and also being a regular advocate for increasing the LatinX representation in the research community. I am also an adjunct professor at Université de Montréal (but not currently taking any new students). Aside from my interest in coding/AI/math, I am an active musician and love running (6 marathons so far, including Boston!). If you would like to chat with me, book some time in my [public office hours](https://calendar.app.google/SRAa924Z2ac2D31x9).'
