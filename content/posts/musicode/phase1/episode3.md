The code for this episode is available [here](https://github.com/psc-g/musicode/tree/main/ep3).

I had it in my head that the third episode would talk about [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)) in the section about Computer Science. Originally I thought the musical would be about chords, but it didn't quite fit well with variables. Then I thought about key signatures, thinking that these are kind of like variables in the sense that you can shift any song into different pitches just by changing key signatures; but again, I wasn't very content with the connection. While walking Lucy (my dog) one day it hit me that [leitmotifs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitmotif) are actually quite similar to variables in the sense that you can reference them at any point, and they hold a particular "value" when called.

Once this was decided, it was clear to me that I wanted the performance bit to include a number of leitmotifs that I'd compose. Since leitmotifs are often used in movies and animations, I decided I would tell some type of story with the visuals. This is in contrast to the types of [visuals](https://twitter.com/pcastr/status/1256079736889016321) I'd done previously, which were mostly _reactive_: it's a set of static rules that simply respond to what I'm playing. I'm a big fan of [Disney's Fantasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasia_(1940_film)) (original and [2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasia_2000)), and I wanted to do something like what was done for the first pieces (Bach's Tocatta and Fugue in the original, and Beethoven's 5th symphony, first movement, for the 2000); specifically, I wanted to be able to tell a story using simple shapes (also, I figured this would just make my animation job easier).

[I asked](https://twitter.com/pcastr/status/1358442602576625668) for pointers to "emotional" animations using simple geometric shapes and got some really interesting suggestions, especially a bunch of experimental films in the [NFB](https://www.nfb.ca/) suggested by my colleague [Fernando Diaz](https://twitter.com/841io). The one that I was most drawn to was [Spheres](https://www.nfb.ca/film/spheres/), and I used that as inspiration for my animation.

I wanted to experiment with smoother movements, so I chose to explore [shaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader). I posted some [initial experiments on Twitter](https://twitter.com/pcastr/status/1364071303272148993) which some people seemed to like, and the "story" came from these initial experiments.

The initial leitmotif I wrote when humming while walking Lucy (I do a lot of thinking when walking Lucy) and the others came from playing around with the animations and my piano.
