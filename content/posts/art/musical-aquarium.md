I created [this website](https://musical-aquarium.glitch.me/) as an experiment to learn [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). It creates programmatic "music" based on the interaction oof the fish you create.

You create fish by clicking anywhere on the screen. The x-axis of the position where you click determines the pitch (taken from the D minor pentatonic scale), while the length of the click determines the size and the speed of the fish.

Whenever the fish bump into each other they "sing" and move away. Enjoy!
