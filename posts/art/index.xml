In a parallel universe I&amp;rsquo;m a full-time musician :D. This page collects the albums I&amp;rsquo;ve released so far, in reverse chronological order. Enjoy!
gregor samsa - amorfo (2023) With my good friend Esteban Nichols, we recorded this jazz fusion album during 2022. It was challenging because Esteban (and Mat√≠as) recorded in Quito, Ecuador, while I recorded in Ottawa! I&amp;rsquo;m quite proud that this album was made with 100% Ecuadorians.</description></item><item><title>Music during COVID-19</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/art/covid-music/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Mar 2021 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/art/covid-music/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been just over a year since COVID-19 forced us all to stay home. It&amp;rsquo;s been a terribly difficult year for so many around the globe, and I don&amp;rsquo;t mean this post to minimize the plight of others, but rather simply highlight one of the silver linings in my past year.
One of the things I miss most from pre-COVID days is playing live. I had to cancel a show with my jazz trio when things started getting locked down.</description></item><item><title>The Cost of Beauty</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/art/cost-of-beauty/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2019 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/art/cost-of-beauty/</guid><description>In &amp;ldquo;The Evolution of Beauty&amp;rdquo;, Richard O. Prum argues that many of the ornaments present in animals need not have an adaptationist purpose (as is the common held belief), but can be the result of the aesthetic choice of the females.
This web app is inspired by that idea. It creates a set of male and female Things that can mate and reproduce.
Courting Males try to seduce females, and females select the most attractive male.</description></item><item><title>Musical Aquarium</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/art/musical-aquarium/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2019 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/art/musical-aquarium/</guid><description>I created this website as an experiment to learn p5.js. It creates programmatic &amp;ldquo;music&amp;rdquo; based on the interaction oof the fish you create.
You create fish by clicking anywhere on the screen. The x-axis of the position where you click determines the pitch (taken from the D minor pentatonic scale), while the length of the click determines the size and the speed of the fish.
Whenever the fish bump into each other they &amp;ldquo;sing&amp;rdquo; and move away.</description></item><item><title>JiDiJi: An Experiment in Musical Representation</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/art/jidiji/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jan 2018 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/art/jidiji/</guid><description>I made this website to convert between music and colours. Read below for details!
About Music can be represented in various forms: as a series of sounds, as a score, as tabs (for guitar), as a series of chord names, as MIDI, as a NoteSequence protocol buffer, and more.
I stumbled upon the Solresol language recently, as well as upon this talk by Adam Neely, and realized that you can also represent music as colours.</description></item><item><title>Family - Over the Years</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/art/family/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 May 2006 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/art/family/</guid><description>We photograph ourselves each year on our anniversary.
