The idea for doing something with bits seemed kind of natural to me as a second episode. After covering what "computation" is, why not cover what computers actually "see" when they run computations?

Given that bits are what makes up everything inside a computer's software, I wanted a musical topic that was inside every type of music (at least in Western music). Initially I was thinking of doing scales, but as I was developing this idea it dawned on me that there is a very close relationship between semitones and tones (or between half-steps and whole-steps) and the zeros and ones of the binary system.

For the creativity bit, I knew I wanted to construct scales based on randomly sampled binary strings. The most challenging part was trying to come up with an idea to improvise with these randomly sampled scales. I played around with a few ideas (such as playing random notes in the scale, or sampling certain chords randomly), but most of them sounded pretty chaotic. In the end I liked the dreamy effect I got from the triads. I think the particles idea came to me from some animation someone had posted on Twitter, but I can't remember which.


### Acknowledgements

Once again, my siblings Alvaro and Melissa, my wife Michelle, and my friend [Ralph](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCroPLKi0ML5xFMYjiHDTyCQ) gave me great feedback in the initial version of this episode. Special thanks to Alvaro, who caught a "bug" I had in the "cluster triad", where I played C, C#, and D, instead of the correct C, D, and E.

I didn't know how to get the assembler code from a C++/Python program, so [I asked Twitter](https://twitter.com/pcastr/status/1340289847504867328). Thanks to all who responded, but especially [Willian H. Hsu](https://twitter.com/banazir/status/1340293096513351681) and [my very good friend Mo](https://twitter.com/moelhelaly/status/1340328424079015937).
