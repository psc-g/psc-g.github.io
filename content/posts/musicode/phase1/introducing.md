A musical ode to musical code.

[Subscribe to the YouTube channel!](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrZNf0XkxtXE0tsy1y2RT0w).

Each episode will explore a topic in Computer Science, a topic in Music, and combine them in creative ways.

You can find the code I use for each episode [here](https://github.com/psc-g/musicode)!

## The story
The reason I decided to start this show was because, thanks to COVID-19, I was no longer performing live with my [jazz trio](https://www.psctrio.com/), but I was aching for some type of performative output. I had recently bought a [disklavier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disklavier), which had been a dream of mine for quite some time, especially after seeing [Dan Tepfer's Natural Machines](https://dantepfer.com/blog/?p=711).

I started playing around with the idea of having a "ghost" piano partner, and with making visualizations based on what I played. But even though it was super fun, I felt it lacked _purpose_. While thinking how to provide purpose to this work, I realized that the reason I enjoyed it so much was because it lived right at the intersection of two things I love: Music & Computer Science.

I also realized that I was somewhat unique in that I knew quite a lot about both those subjects, and had extensive experience with both. Then the idea struck me to make a YouTube channel talking about a topic from each.

I'm a big fan of creativity under constraints, and I thought it'd be an interesting and fun challenge to try to come up with a creative production that was based on the two topics covered.

I started working on the first episode right away.
