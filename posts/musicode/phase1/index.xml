&lt;p>Loops are such an essential part of programming that I knew I&amp;rsquo;d have to make an episode on them at some point. A natural musical analogue is musical repeats, so the whole episode came fairly naturally!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be fun to have some beats to accompany the piano, so I used SuperCollider for that. That proved to be the most challenging part of the episode, as getting the timing right was &lt;em>really&lt;/em> hard. A big part of the difficulty is that there&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em>mechanical&lt;/em> latecy induced by the piano, since the hammers have to physically strike the strings! In the end I&amp;rsquo;m pleased enough with the output, although I think I could have done better&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Episode 4: Live Coding &amp; Jazz</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/musicode/phase1/episode4/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Apr 2021 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/musicode/phase1/episode4/</guid><description>&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oj6Sre4Lhac" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>&lt;/iframe>

&lt;p>I had a different idea for the fourth episode, but then I saw &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jmcl_gtr/status/1372490033391927296">John McLaughlin&amp;rsquo;s tweet&lt;/a> about International Jazz day, and decided to do something for that instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously I&amp;rsquo;d talk about Jazz in the musical section, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear yet &lt;em>what&lt;/em> part of Jazz I&amp;rsquo;d talk about. I spoke to a few people and it seemed like a good idea would be to talk about improvisation, and how jazz musicians do it; in particular, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping this helps people who don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;get&amp;rdquo; jazz to understand what we&amp;rsquo;re doing when we play it, and that we&amp;rsquo;re not just playing random notes! :)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Episode 3: Leitmotifs &amp; Variables</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/musicode/phase1/episode3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Mar 2021 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/musicode/phase1/episode3/</guid><description>&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o4qUKFHPPnw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>&lt;/iframe>

&lt;p>I had it in my head that the third episode would talk about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)">variables&lt;/a> in the section about Computer Science. Originally I thought the musical would be about chords, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t quite fit well with variables. Then I thought about key signatures, thinking that these are kind of like variables in the sense that you can shift any song into different pitches just by changing key signatures; but again, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t very content with the connection. While walking Lucy (my dog) one day it hit me that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitmotif">leitmotifs&lt;/a> are actually quite similar to variables in the sense that you can reference them at any point, and they hold a particular &amp;ldquo;value&amp;rdquo; when called.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Episode 2: Bits &amp; Semitones</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/musicode/phase1/episode2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2021 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/musicode/phase1/episode2/</guid><description>&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_d4M1gthsXA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>&lt;/iframe>

&lt;p>The idea for doing something with bits seemed kind of natural to me as a second episode. After covering what &amp;ldquo;computation&amp;rdquo; is, why not cover what computers actually &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; when they run computations?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given that bits are what makes up everything inside a computer&amp;rsquo;s software, I wanted a musical topic that was inside every type of music (at least in Western music). Initially I was thinking of doing scales, but as I was developing this idea it dawned on me that there is a very close relationship between semitones and tones (or between half-steps and whole-steps) and the zeros and ones of the binary system.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Episode 1: Musical Notes &amp; Computation</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/musicode/phase1/episode1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/musicode/phase1/episode1/</guid><description>&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BrxO-Lssnjg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>&lt;/iframe>

&lt;p>I originally thought this channel would be a kind of educational channel, where people could learn about both music and computer science in a fun and informal way. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pcastr/status/1296122430977716224">I tweeted asking for suggestions for what to cover first on the CS side&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/korymath/status/1296122717318590465">Kory Mathewson&amp;rsquo;s response&lt;/a> was my favourite.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the music side, it was kind of a train-of-thought process. The first thing that came to mind when thinking about the first thing you might learn in music theory was musical notes themselves.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introducing MUSICODE</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/musicode/phase1/introducing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jan 2021 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/musicode/phase1/introducing/</guid><description>&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jmoFkx0iGB4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>&lt;/iframe>

&lt;p>The reason I decided to start this show was because, thanks to COVID-19, I was no longer performing live with my &lt;a href="https://www.psctrio.com/">jazz trio&lt;/a>, but I was aching for some type of performative output. I had recently bought a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disklavier">disklavier&lt;/a>, which had been a dream of mine for quite some time, especially after seeing &lt;a href="https://dantepfer.com/blog/?p=711">Dan Tepfer&amp;rsquo;s Natural Machines&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
