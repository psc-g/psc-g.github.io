The code for this episode is available [here](https://github.com/psc-g/musicode/tree/main/ep1).

I originally thought this channel would be a kind of educational channel, where people could learn about both music and computer science in a fun and informal way. [I tweeted asking for suggestions for what to cover first on the CS side](https://twitter.com/pcastr/status/1296122430977716224), and [Kory Mathewson's response](https://twitter.com/korymath/status/1296122717318590465) was my favourite.

On the music side, it was kind of a train-of-thought process. The first thing that came to mind when thinking about the first thing you might learn in music theory was musical notes themselves.

For the creativity bit, I thought I'd use an idea I had already been experimenting with, which was to "record" a performance and then play it back in reverse. The code that I put up actually allows you to also play it back in its negative harmony ([see this thread for an example](https://twitter.com/pcastr/status/1346654481451245569).


### Acknowledgements

A lot of the work I do in this space was originally inspired by the amazing projects [Dan Tepfer](https://dantepfer.com/) has made with his Disklavier. I've hung out a few times with Dan, and he even helped me pick my Disklavier, but I haven't had the chance to jam with him (yet!).

My good friend Ralph Crewe helped a lot with the technical details of making this first episode, including making me realize I needed good lights and helping me pick them! You should definitely check out his YouTube channel, [Isn't that something?](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCroPLKi0ML5xFMYjiHDTyCQ), which is incredibly entertaining and informative, and was an inspiration for my own channel!

Unknowingly, my friend Kory Mathewson [suggested the topic for the CS bit](https://twitter.com/korymath/status/1296122717318590465), so I thank him for that!

Finally, many thanks to my wife Michelle and my siblings Alvaro and Melissa for providing great feedback on early versions of this episode!
