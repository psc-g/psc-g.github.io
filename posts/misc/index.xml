This game is particularly meaningful for those of us that do RL research, as it is one of the games that is part of the &lt;a href="https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/10819">Arcade Learning Environment&lt;/a>, one of the most popular benchmarks. Pong is probably the easiest game of the whole suite, so we often use it as a test to make sure our agents are learning. Learning curves below are for agents trained with the &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/dopamine">Dopamine&lt;/a> framework.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Crosswords: A General Intelligence Challenge?</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/misc/crosswords/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2022 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/misc/crosswords/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have become obsessed with crossword puzzles, specifically
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords">the NYT crosswords&lt;/a>, since
my friend Ralph Crewe gently forced me to start doing them.
Although I&amp;rsquo;m not still at his level, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on them
daily and getting noticeably better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In doing so I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize they are a fantastic mechanism for testing
generally capable problem-solving, and in this post would like to explain the
various types of challenges they present. I&amp;rsquo;ll be using past NYT crossword
puzzles as examples (they&amp;rsquo;re all at least a week old so should hopefully not be
spoilers for anyone).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>yovoy</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/misc/yovoy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/misc/yovoy/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="what-is-a-palindrome">What is a palindrome?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>A &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome">palindrome&lt;/a> is a phrase that reads
the same way from left to right, and right to left. The rules are that all characters
must be used in both directions, but punctuation, capitalization, and spaces can be
ignored.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>¡Las mismas reglas en español!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some well-known Palindromes:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Do geese see god?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Yo, banana boy!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Unos palíndromos en español:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Dábale arroz a la zorra el abad.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Origins of April Fool's Day</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/misc/origins/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2021 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/misc/origins/</guid><description>&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>&lt;/iframe></description></item><item><title>Artificial General Relativity</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/misc/agr/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2020 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/misc/agr/</guid><description>&lt;p>We (well, I) introduce a New Field In Science which we (I mean I) call Artificial General Relativity. We
(here I really mean &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo;) have all heard of General Relativity and how it revolutionized our understanding of
the world around us. Einstein&amp;rsquo;s work, although pivotal, failed in one crucial aspect: although it allowed us to
describe gravity and spacetime, it did not allow us to control them. In this paper I (switching to &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; to avoid
sounding pretentious with &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo;) introduce Artificial General Relativity (AGR) which, when achieved, will
allow us to control gravity and spacetime. I present a set of practical approaches to achieve AGR which serve
as reasonable baselines for future work.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
