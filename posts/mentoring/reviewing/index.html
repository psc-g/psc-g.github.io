there will likely be lots of complaining about the quality of reviews when they
come out (I&rsquo;m often guilty of this type of complaint).</p><p>I decided to write a post describing how I approach paper-reviewing, in the help
that it can be useful for others (especially those who are new to reviewing) in
writing high quality reviews.</p><p>I&rsquo;m mostly an RL researcher, so a lot of the tips below are mostly from my
experience reading RL papers. I think many of the ideas are applicable more
generally, but I acknowledge some may be more RL-specific.</p><p>If you have feedback on any of the points below (or if you feel there are points
I&rsquo;m missing), <a href=https://twitter.com/pcastr>let me know</a>!</p><h2 id=tools>Tools</h2><p>I do all my paper reading on my iPad. I use <a href=https://pdfexpert.com/>PDF Expert</a>
connected to my <a href=https://drive.google.com/corp/drive/my-drive>Google Drive</a>, where
I organize papers in sub-folders for topics (and I&rsquo;ll have one for reviews).</p><p>The reason I like this setup is that it avoids me having to print anything, I can
access my annotated papers from anywhere, and it&rsquo;s easier to keep track of papers
that I have/want to read.</p><h2 id=timeline>Timeline</h2><p>I start reviewing pretty much as soon as the review assignments come out. This
means I can review at a fairly leisurely pace and I have enough buffer time for
papers that require more attention.</p><h2 id=randomizing-order>Randomizing order</h2><p>There is apparently <em>some</em> correlation between paper ID and acceptance rate, and
there are likely many causal factors that explain that correlation. But to try
to avoid any such biases, I try to review the papers in some type of random
order (or at least not just front-to-back or back-to-front).</p><h2 id=entering-reviews>Entering reviews</h2><p>I annotate the PDFs of the papers I&rsquo;m reviewing and write down an initial
assessment (accept, weak accept, etc.), but I <em>don&rsquo;t</em> enter my review or score
into CMT/OpenReview/etc until I&rsquo;m done reviewing all the papers. The reason I
do this is because it allows me to calibrate myself across all the papers (e.g.
I may have reviewed the first paper more leniently/harshly than I did the later
papers).</p><h2 id=doing-the-reviews>Doing the reviews</h2><p>Each section below explores different aspects I consider when reviewing.</p><h3 id=problem-and-contribution>Problem and contribution</h3><blockquote><p><strong>What is the problem the paper is addressing? How is this paper contributing
to understanding/solving the problem?</strong></p></blockquote><p>Alternatively: What is the main message of the paper? Is it clearly stated?
Could I summarize the paper in one or two sentences?</p><p>This is useful not just for contextualizing the results, but also when entering
the reviews as you are typically asked to provide a summary. It is also for the
other reviewers and AC of the paper, as it helps ensure that the different
reviewers understood the paper in the same way.</p><h3 id=impact>Impact</h3><blockquote><p><strong>Can future research build on these results?</strong></p></blockquote><p>There is often an unfortunate tendency to require &ldquo;state-of-the-art&rdquo; results for
a paper to be accepted. In my view, this is the wrong yardstick on which to evaluate
scientific merit. I think the value of a paper should come from whether I feel
future work can build on it.</p><p>In the meta-reviews I received for <a href=https://psc-g.github.io/posts/research/rl/scalable/>one of my papers</a>
the AC said there was a fair bit of discussion between the reviewers, but in the
end they decided to accept it because they felt future research could build off of it.
I&rsquo;m happy to see that <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=14556082876399502510">it is in fact the case</a>.</p><p>Of course, state-of-the-art results are important and can be meaningful, but
only if it the methodology is reproducible, well-explained, and robustly
evaluated (more on this below).</p><h3 id=theoretical-results>Theoretical results</h3><blockquote><p><strong>Are the theoretical results clearly presented, meaningful, and useful?</strong></p></blockquote><p>Theory is nice, but in my view it needs to serve a purpose. You don&rsquo;t get extra
points just for including a theorem in your paper if that theorem is just
showing a completely vacuous bound.</p><p>On the other hand, demonstrating how an algorithmic contribution can be
derived from theoretical principles is a great way for motivating design
decisions.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not going to lie, reviewing theoretical results can be hard. But
<em>just reading the theorem/proposition is not enough</em>! Please make an
effort to go through the proofs and try to understand the development. I
have found errors in the proofs of a number of papers I have reviewed
(often the authors were able to fix the proofs in time).</p><p>If you don&rsquo;t understand something in a proof, <em>it&rsquo;s ok to ask questions</em>!
Try to honestly gauge your level of expertise. If you <em>feel</em> like you
should be able to follow proofs of the type you&rsquo;re reading, then it&rsquo;s
possible the authors did a poor job of presenting it. Ask the authors
to clarify the proof, it will only help in clarity (and may sometimes
even reveal a bug in the proof!).</p><p>I find some theoretical papers can go a little overboard with notation;
this can include very long theorem statements (I once reviewed a paper
with a theorem that took a full double-column page to state!) and
excessive use of variables (I once reviewed a paper that ran out of
Greek letters!). These papers are <em>extremely</em> hard to read, even for
experts; as stated above, the contributions made should be clear
so others can build on it. Proof sketches, high-level theorem
summaries, and illustrative examples can go a long way in helping
clarify things without sacrificing mathematical correctness.</p><h3 id=empirical-results>Empirical results</h3><blockquote><p><strong>Were the experiments well-designed, carefully executed, clearly explained, and fairly evaluated?</strong></p></blockquote><p>There have beeen a number of papers in the past few years pointing out
the lack of rigour in empirical evaluations: cherry-picking seeds,
unfair comparisons against baselines, insufficient independent runs, etc.</p><p>Things I look out for in evaluating empirical results are:</p><ul><li>How many independent runs were used? In my opinion 3 is the bare minimum, but
5 is ok especially if running on expensive environments like the
<a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.4708>ALE</a>.</li><li>Do their performance curves report variance via confidence intervals,
standard deviation, or other? If not: ask for them! Is the choice of
confidence level (e.g. 90%, 95%, etc.) justified? Ask what method they
used to compute the confidence intervals; they should probably be using
bootstrapping, but that is not what most people use.</li><li>Are the authors comparing against reasonable baselines? If not, ask them why!</li><li>It is common for authors to <strong>bold</strong> the &ldquo;winners&rdquo; in tables (typically
their method). This should <em>only</em> be done if the confidence intervals
between the compared methods <em>don&rsquo;t</em> overlap; if they do overlap, then the
result is not significant and the authors should <em>not</em> be bolding! Note that
non-overlapping confidence intervals is a good first order approximation,
but a more rigorous statistical test would really be best.</li><li>If the new algorithm and the baseline share hyperparameters and these were
tuned for the new proposed algorithm, were they also tuned for the baseline?
If not: ask why!</li><li>Is the algorithm/method understandable? Do you feel like you could implement
it based on the description given? Diagrams/figures can go a long way in
helping clarify architectures and multi-component systems. Remember: one of
the important points for accepting a paper is whether others can build off
of the idea!</li><li>Is there code provided? This is becoming increasingly important as there are
often implementation details which, while seemingly unimportant, can be
crucial to an algorithm&rsquo;s success. I will often at least glance through the
code to make sure it seems to match what is being described in the paper.</li></ul><h3 id=supplemental-material>Supplemental material</h3><blockquote><p><strong>Read the supplemental material!</strong></p></blockquote><p>Although we&rsquo;re typically not required to look at supplemental material, I find
it important to do so. Often there are important details there (proofs, extended
empirical evaluations, hyperparameter settings, code) that are important
in properly evaluating a paper.</p><p>Occasionally I have suggested to authors that certain parts of the supplemental
should be put in the main paper, replacing some other main section that I found
less important to the paper&rsquo;s central message.</p><h2 id=self-evaluation>Self-evaluation</h2><blockquote><p><strong>Do I know this field well enough and do I feel I understood the paper well enough?</strong></p></blockquote><p>Please be honest with yourself. It&rsquo;s ok to say you are unfamiliar with the field
and/or that you were not able to follow the paper; if other reviewers were also
confused then it might be a good indication that the authors did not do a good
job presenting their work. Making an honest assessment of your confidence on your
review can also help the AC properly weigh the various points made.</p><h2 id=discussion-period>Discussion period</h2><blockquote><p><strong>Participate throughout the discussion period!</strong></p></blockquote><p>Get started early in the discussion period! If no one has started the discussion,
start it yourself! It&rsquo;s important to read the other reviews to see on what points
you&rsquo;re in agreement/disagreement. If you seem to be in disagreement with most of
the other reviewers, that&rsquo;s ok, but be prepared to defend your position!</p><p>Also: <em>it&rsquo;s ok to change your mind</em>! That&rsquo;s part of why the discussion period is
there! Don&rsquo;t feel shy to challenge other reviewers (even if they&rsquo;re more senior
than you) in a respectful manner, and don&rsquo;t feel embarassed to say &ldquo;I was mistaken,
I&rsquo;m going to change my score&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Reviewing is a very important part of academia, but it takes time to do well. If you
feel you don&rsquo;t have the time to review, then it may be better to not accept invitations
to review. My rule for accepting invitations is:</p><ul><li>Always review for conferences where I&rsquo;m submitting</li><li>Always review journal papers that are in my area of research</li><li>(Mostly) always review for LatinX in AI, Black in AI, and similar workshops.</li></ul><p>I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from reviewing papers: good things to include in my own papers,
bad things to avoid, proof techniques, and interesting algorithmic ideas. View
it as a learning opportunity and as a way to improve our field; you&rsquo;ll want high
quality reviewers for your own papers!</p><p>Finally, I approach reviewing the way I approach interviewing candidates:</p><blockquote><p><em>Look for reasons to accept the paper, rather than looking for reasons to reject
the paper.</em></p></blockquote><p>Thanks, and good luck!</p><h2 id=acknowledgements>Acknowledgements</h2><p>Thanks to Marlos C. Machado and Johan Samir Obando-Ceron for their feedback in
