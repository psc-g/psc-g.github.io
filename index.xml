The code is available here.
At a high level what it does is use the spectrogram of a piece of audio (from a video, for example) to &amp;ldquo;draw&amp;rdquo; a path in the latent space of a BigGAN.
GANs GANs are generative models trained to reproduce images from a given dataset.</description></item><item><title>Introduction to reinforcement learning</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/mentoring/intro-to-rl/intro-to-rl/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2020 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/mentoring/intro-to-rl/intro-to-rl/</guid><description>This post is based on this colab.

Introduction Reinforcement learning methods are used for sequential decision making in uncertain environments. It is typically framed as an agent (the learner) interacting with an environment which provides the agent with reinforcement (positive or negative), based on the agent&amp;rsquo;s decisions.</description></item><item><title>Rigging the Lottery: Making All Tickets Winners</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/research/other/rigl/rigl/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2020 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/research/other/rigl/rigl/</guid><description>Rigging the Lottery: Making All Tickets Winners is a paper published at ICML 2020 with Utku Evci, Trevor Gale, Jacob Menick, and Erich Elsen, where we introduce an algorithm for training sparse neural networks that uses a fixed parameter count and computational cost throughout training, without sacrificing accuracy relative to existing dense-to-sparse training methods.

We (here I really mean &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo;) have all heard of General Relativity and how it revolutionized our understanding of the world around us. Einstein&amp;rsquo;s work, although pivotal, failed in one crucial aspect: although it allowed us to describe gravity and spacetime, it did not allow us to control them. In this paper I (switching to &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; to avoid sounding pretentious with &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo;) introduce Artificial General Relativity (AGR) which, when achieved, will allow us to control gravity and spacetime.</description></item><item><title>GridWorld Playground</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/mentoring/gridworldplayground/gridworldplayground/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/mentoring/gridworldplayground/gridworldplayground/</guid><description>GridWorld playground!

People often ask me: How do I get a job at Google?
An essential requirement is passing the interviews; unsurprisingly, this is another common question: How do I pass the Google interviews?
While there is no hard and fast rule to pass the Google interviews, I do have some tips and guidelines that have helped others in the past (including myself).</description></item><item><title>Tips for preparing your resume</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/mentoring/resume/resume/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2020 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/mentoring/resume/resume/</guid><description>Disclaimer: This post reflects my personal views and not those of my employer.
In my previous post providing tips for interviewing at Google, I included the sentence “If you don’t know anyone at Google, you’ve already applied and haven’t heard back in a while, feel free to send me a note with your CV and I’ll see if there’s something I can do.”
I received a number of requests from people who had applied but never heard back.</description></item><item><title>Scalable methods for computing state similarity in deterministic MDPs</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/research/rl/scalable/scalable/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Nov 2019 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/research/rl/scalable/scalable/</guid><description>This post describes my paper Scalable methods for computing state similarity in deterministic MDPs, published at AAAI 2020. The code is available here.
Motivation We consider distance metrics between states in an MDP. Take the following MDP, where the goal is to reach the green cells:
Physical distance betweent states? Physical distance often fails to capture the similarity properties we&amp;rsquo;d like:
State abstractions Now imagine we add an exact copy of these states to the MDP (think of it as an additional &amp;ldquo;floor&amp;rdquo;):</description></item><item><title>The Cost of Beauty</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/art/cost-of-beauty/cost-of-beauty/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2019 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/art/cost-of-beauty/cost-of-beauty/</guid><description>In &amp;ldquo;The Evolution of Beauty&amp;rdquo;, Richard O. Prum argues that many of the ornaments present in animals need not have an adaptationist purpose (as is the common held belief), but can be the result of the aesthetic choice of the females.
This web app is inspired by that idea. It creates a set of male and female Things that can mate and reproduce.
Courting Males try to seduce females, and females select the most attractive male.</description></item><item><title>ML-Jam: Performing Structured Improvisations with Pre-trained Models</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/research/creativity/ml-jam/ml-jam/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2019 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/research/creativity/ml-jam/ml-jam/</guid><description>This paper, published in the International Conference on Computational Creativity, 2019, explores using pre-trained musical generative models in a collaborative setting for improvisation.

It was originally written in TensorFlow, but now all agents have been implemented in JAX.
You can read more about it in our github page and in our white paper.

We have a website where you can easily compare the performance of all the Dopamine agents, which I find really useful:

About Music can be represented in various forms: as a series of sounds, as a score, as tabs (for guitar), as a series of chord names, as MIDI, as a NoteSequence protocol buffer, and more.
I stumbled upon the Solresol language recently, as well as upon this talk by Adam Neely, and realized that you can also represent music as colours.</description></item><item><title>Family - Over the Years</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/art/family/family/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 May 2006 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/art/family/family/</guid><description>We photograph ourselves each year on our anniversary.
