Loops are such an essential part of programming that I knew I'd have to make an episode on them at some point. A natural musical analogue is musical repeats, so the whole episode came fairly naturally!

I thought it'd be fun to have some beats to accompany the piano, so I used SuperCollider for that. That proved to be the most challenging part of the episode, as getting the timing right was _really_ hard. A big part of the difficulty is that there's a _mechanical_ latecy induced by the piano, since the hammers have to physically strike the strings! In the end I'm pleased enough with the output, although I think I could have done better...

One thing I liked about this episode was the circular keyboard, which I think is a neat way to visualize a piano.
