I've been in bands since I was 12. In a parallel universe I'm a full-time musician :D. This page collects the albums I've released so far, in reverse chronological order. Enjoy!

## gregor samsa - amorfo (2023)

With my good friend Esteban Nichols, we recorded this jazz fusion album during 2022. It was challenging because Esteban (and Matías) recorded in Quito, Ecuador, while I recorded in Ottawa! I'm quite proud that this album was made with 100% Ecuadorians. I hope you enjoy the tunes!

## psc trio - brave new world (2018)

My good friend Claudio Palomares (with whom I played in ecos de portoalegre) encouraged me to start a jazz trio with some of the songs I had been writing. This was the product! This trio was quite active in Montreal until COVID ruined it all :(.

## Cártel - demo (1996)

This was my first band during high school, in Quito, Ecuador. The friends I made there still remain some of my closest to this day. We won second place in a city-wide battle of the bands with my song "Mi Realidad" (incorrectly named in the picture below), which gave me a scholarship for my last year of high school. Right before I left to Canada, we recorded a demo. Click on each track to listen.
