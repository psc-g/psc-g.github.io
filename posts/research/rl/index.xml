The code is available here.
Motivation We consider distance metrics between states in an MDP. Take the following MDP, where the goal is to reach the green cells:
Physical distance betweent states? Physical distance often fails to capture the similarity properties we&amp;rsquo;d like:
State abstractions Now imagine we add an exact copy of these states to the MDP (think of it as an additional &amp;ldquo;floor&amp;rdquo;):</description></item><item><title>Dopamine: A framework for flexible value-based reinforcement learning research</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/research/rl/dopamine/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Aug 2018 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/research/rl/dopamine/</guid><description>Dopamine is a framework for flexible, value-based, reinforcement learning research. It was originally written in TensorFlow, but now all agents have been implemented in JAX.
You can read more about it in our github page and in our white paper.
Original Google AI blogpost.
We have a website where you can easily compare the performance of all the Dopamine agents, which I find really useful:
.
We also provide a set of Colaboratory notebooks that really help understand the framework:</description></item></channel></rss>
