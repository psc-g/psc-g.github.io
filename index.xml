Specifically, we use deep reinforcement learning to help control the navigation of stratospheric balloons, whose purpose is to deliver internet to areas with low connectivity. This project is an ongoing collaboration with Loon.
It&amp;rsquo;s been incredibly rewarding to see reinforcement learning deployed successfully in a real setting. It&amp;rsquo;s also been terrific to work alongside such fantastic co-authors: Marc G.</description></item><item><title>Revisiting Rainbow: Promoting more insightful and inclusive deep reinforcement learning research</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/research/rl/revisiting_rainbow/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Nov 2020 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/research/rl/revisiting_rainbow/</guid><description>We argue for the value of small- to mid-scale environments in deep RL for increasing scientific insight and help make our community more inclusive.

At a high level what it does is use the spectrogram of a piece of audio (from a video, for example) to &amp;ldquo;draw&amp;rdquo; a path in the latent space of a BigGAN.

Introduction Reinforcement learning methods are used for sequential decision making in uncertain environments. It is typically framed as an agent (the learner) interacting with an environment which provides the agent with reinforcement (positive or negative), based on the agent&amp;rsquo;s decisions.</description></item><item><title>Rigging the Lottery: Making All Tickets Winners</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/research/other/rigl/rigl/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2020 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/research/other/rigl/rigl/</guid><description>Rigging the Lottery: Making All Tickets Winners is a paper published at ICML 2020 with Utku Evci, Trevor Gale, Jacob Menick, and Erich Elsen, where we introduce an algorithm for training sparse neural networks that uses a fixed parameter count and computational cost throughout training, without sacrificing accuracy relative to existing dense-to-sparse training methods.

We (here I really mean &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo;) have all heard of General Relativity and how it revolutionized our understanding of the world around us. Einstein&amp;rsquo;s work, although pivotal, failed in one crucial aspect: although it allowed us to describe gravity and spacetime, it did not allow us to control them. In this paper I (switching to &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; to avoid sounding pretentious with &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo;) introduce Artificial General Relativity (AGR) which, when achieved, will allow us to control gravity and spacetime.</description></item><item><title>GridWorld Playground</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/mentoring/gridworldplayground/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/mentoring/gridworldplayground/</guid><description>GridWorld playground!

People often ask me: How do I get a job at Google?
An essential requirement is passing the interviews; unsurprisingly, this is another common question: How do I pass the Google interviews?
While there is no hard and fast rule to pass the Google interviews, I do have some tips and guidelines that have helped others in the past (including myself).</description></item><item><title>Tips for preparing your resume</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/mentoring/resume/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2020 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/mentoring/resume/</guid><description>Disclaimer: This post reflects my personal views and not those of my employer.
In my previous post providing tips for interviewing at Google, I included the sentence “If you don’t know anyone at Google, you’ve already applied and haven’t heard back in a while, feel free to send me a note with your CV and I’ll see if there’s something I can do.”

The code is available here.
Motivation We consider distance metrics between states in an MDP. Take the following MDP, where the goal is to reach the green cells:
Physical distance betweent states? Physical distance often fails to capture the similarity properties we&amp;rsquo;d like:
State abstractions Now imagine we add an exact copy of these states to the MDP (think of it as an additional &amp;ldquo;floor&amp;rdquo;):</description></item><item><title>The Cost of Beauty</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/art/cost-of-beauty/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2019 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/art/cost-of-beauty/</guid><description>In &amp;ldquo;The Evolution of Beauty&amp;rdquo;, Richard O. Prum argues that many of the ornaments present in animals need not have an adaptationist purpose (as is the common held belief), but can be the result of the aesthetic choice of the females.
This web app is inspired by that idea. It creates a set of male and female Things that can mate and reproduce.

It creates programmatic &amp;ldquo;music&amp;rdquo; based on the interaction oof the fish you create.
You create fish by clicking anywhere on the screen. The x-axis of the position where you click determines the pitch (taken from the D minor pentatonic scale), while the length of the click determines the size and the speed of the fish.
Whenever the fish bump into each other they &amp;ldquo;sing&amp;rdquo; and move away.</description></item><item><title>Dopamine: A framework for flexible value-based reinforcement learning research</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/research/rl/dopamine/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Aug 2018 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/research/rl/dopamine/</guid><description>Dopamine is a framework for flexible, value-based, reinforcement learning research.
