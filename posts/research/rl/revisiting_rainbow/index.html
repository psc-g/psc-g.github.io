reinforcement learning has witnessed a dramatic
increase in research papers (<a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06560>Henderson et al., 2018</a>). A large portion of these papers propose new
methods that build on the original DQN algorithm and network architecture, often adapting methods
introduced before DQN to work well with deep networks. New methods are typically evaluated on a set of environments that have now
become standard, such as the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)
(<a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.4708>Bellemare et al., 2012</a>) and the control tasks available in MuJoCo and DM control suites
(<a href=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6386109>Todorov et al., 2012</a>), (<a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12983>Tassa et al., 2020</a>).</p><p>While these benchmarks have helped to evaluate new methods in a standardized manner, they have
also implicitly established a minimum amount of computing power in order to be recognized as
valid scientific contributions.</p><p>Furthermore, at a time when efforts such as <a href=https://blackinai2020.vercel.app/>Black in AI</a> and <a href=http://www.latinxinai.org/>LatinX in AI</a> are helping bring people from
underrepresented (and typically underprivileged) segments of society into the research community,
these newcomers are faced with enormous computational hurdles to overcome if they wish to be an
integral part of said community.</p><p>In this work we argue for a need to change the status-quo in evaluating and proposing new research to avoid
exacerbating the barriers to entry for newcomers from underprivileged communities.</p><p>We complement
this argument by revisiting the Rainbow algorithm (<a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298>Hessel et al., 2018</a>), which proposed a new state
of the art algorithm by combining a number of recent advances, on a set of small- and medium-sized
tasks. This allows us to conduct a “counterfactual” analysis: would Hessel et al. [2018] have reached
the same conclusions if they had run on the smaller-scale experiments we investigate here? We extend
this analysis by investigating the interaction between the different algorithms considered and the
network architecture used; this is an element not explored by Hessel et al. [2018], yet as we show
below, is crucial for proper evaluation of the methods under consideration.</p><p>This blog post is structured as follows:</p><ul><li>We first present a rough estimate of <a href=#the-cost-of-rainbow>the computational and economic cost of
rainbow</a>, highlighting how these types of papers could
only come from large research groups.</li><li>In <a href=#revisiting-rainbow>Revisiting Rainbow</a> we revisit the original Rainbow experiments using a set of small- and mid-scale environments. We investigate whether the same conclusions would have been reached as in the original paper, but with a reduced computational expense.</li><li>In <a href=#beyond-the-rainbow>Beyond the Rainbow</a> we leverage the low computational cost of our chosen environment suites and perform an investigation into <a href=#network-architectures--batch-sizes>network architectures and batch sizes</a>, <a href=#distribution-parameterizations>distribution parameterizations</a>, <a href=#munchausen-rl>Munchausen RL</a>, and <a href=#reevaluating-the-huber-loss>reevaluating the Huber loss</a>.</li><li>We compare all our different Rainbow variants in <a href=#rainbow-flavours>rainbow flavours</a>.</li><li>Finally, we present some concluding remarks.</li></ul><h1 id=the-cost-of-rainbow>The Cost of Rainbow</h1><p>Although the value of the Rainbow agent is undeniable, this result
could have only come from a large research laboratory with ample access to compute:</p><ul><li>It takes roughly 5 days to train an Atari game on a Tesla P100 GPU</li><li>There are 57 games in total</li><li>To report performance with confidence bounds it is common to use at least five independent runs</li></ul><p>Thus, to provide the convincing empirical evidence for Rainbow, Hessel et al. [2018] required
at least 34,200 GPU hours (or 1425 days); in other words, these experiments <em>must</em> be run in parallel with multiple GPUs.</p><p>Considering that the cost of a Tesla P100 is about US<span>$</span>6,000, it becomes prohibitively expensive for
smaller research laboratories. To put things in perspective, the average minimum monthly wage in Latin America
(excluding Venezuela) is approximately US<span>$</span>313 (data taken from <a href=https://www.statista.com/statistics/953880/latin-america-minimum-monthly-wages/>here</a>);
in other words, <em>one GPU is the equivalent of approximately 20 minimum wages.</em> Needless to say, this is far from inclusive.</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/revisiting_rainbow/minimumWage.png alt="Minimum wage in LATAM" class=center><p>In light of this, we wish to investigate three questions:</p><ol><li>Would Hessel et al. (2018) have arrived at the same qualitative conclusions, had they run their experiments on a set of smaller-scale experiments?</li><li>Do the results of Hessel et al. (2018) generalize well to non-ALE environments, or are their results overlyspecific to the chosen benchmark?</li><li>Is there scientific value in conducting empirical research in reinforcement learning when restricting oneself to small- to mid-scale environments?</li></ol><p>We investigate the first two in the next section, and the last in <a href=#beyond-the-rainbow>Beyond the Rainbow</a>.</p><h2 id=revisiting-rainbow>Revisiting Rainbow</h2><p>As in the original Rainbow paper, we evaluate the effect of adding the following components to the original DQN algorithm:</p><ul><li><strong><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461>Double Q-learning</a></strong> mitigates overestimation bias in the Q-estimates by decoupling the maximization of the action from its selection
in the target bootstrap.</li><li><strong><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952>Prioritized experience replay</a></strong> samples trajectories from the replay buffer proportional to their respective temporal difference error.</li><li><strong><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06581>Dueling networks</a></strong> uses two streams sharing the initial convolutional layers, separately estimating $V^*(s)$ and the advantages for each action</li><li><strong><a href=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00115009>Multi-step learning</a></strong> uses multi-step targets for temporal difference learning</li><li><strong><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06887>Distributional RL</a></strong> maintains estimates of return distributions, rather than return values.</li><li><strong><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.10295>Noisy Nets</a></strong> replaces standard $\epsilon$-greedy exploration with noisy linear layers that include a noisy stream.</li></ul><h3 id=classic-control>Classic control</h3><p>Our first set of experiments were performed on four classic control environments: CartPole, Acrobot, LunarLander, and MountainCar. We first investigate the effect of independently adding each algorithmic component to DQN (top row):</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/revisiting_rainbow/revisitingClassic.png alt="Revisiting Rainbow Classic"><p>Just like Hessel et al. [2018] we find that, in aggregate, the addition of each of these algorithms does
improve learning over the base DQN. However, while
Hessel et al. [2018] found prioritized replay and multi-step to be the most
impactful additions, in these environments the gains from these additions are
more tempered.
What is most interesting is that when distributional RL is added to DQN <em>without
any of the other components</em>, the gains can sometimes be minimal (see
LunarLander), and can sometimes have a large negative effect on learning
(Acrobot and MountainCar). This is consistent across the various learning rates we considered.</p><p>In contrast, when we look at the <em>removal</em> of each of these components from the full Rainbow agent (bottom row in above figure),
we can see that what hurts the most is the removal of distributional RL. These results suggest there is a symbiotic between distributional RL and one of the other
algorithms considered, an investigation that warrants investigation in future work, along the lines
of the theoretical investigation by <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11084>Lyle et al. [2019]</a>, which demonstrated that the combination of
distributional RL with non-linear function approximators can sometimes have adverse effects on
training.</p><h3 id=minatar>MinAtar</h3><p>In order to strengthen <a href=https://youtu.be/WS3Lkc6Gzlk>the Rainbow connection</a>, we also ran a set of experiments on the MinAtar
environment <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03176>Young and Tian, 2019</a>, which is a set of miniaturized versions of five ALE games
(Asterix, Breakout, Freeway, Seaquest, and SpaceInvaders). These environments are considerably
larger than the four classic control environments previously explored, but they are significantly faster
to train than regular ALE environments. Specifically, training one of these agents takes approximately
12-14 hours on a P100 GPU. For these experiments, we followed the network architecture used by
Young and Tian [2019] consisting of a single convolutional layer followed by a linear layer.</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/revisiting_rainbow/minatar.png alt=MinAtar width=50% class=center><p>In these experiments we still find distributional RL to be the most significant of the additions, but it
does not seem to require being coupled with another algorithm to produce improvements. This begs
the question as to whether the use of distributional RL with convolutional layers avoids the pitfalls
sometimes observed in the classic control experiments. However, the results from Seaquest suggest
that the combination with one of the algorithms is hurting performance; based on the ablation results
from Rainbow, it appears that noisy networks have a detrimental effect on performance.</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/revisiting_rainbow/revisitingMinatar.png alt="Revisiting Minatar"><h3 id=conclusions>Conclusions</h3><p>When viewed in aggregate we find our results consistent with those of <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298>Hessel et al., 2018</a>: the results
for each algorithmic component can vary from environment to environment. If we were to suggest
a single agent that balances the tradeoffs of the different algorithmic components, our version of
Rainbow would likely be consistent with Hessel et al.: combining all components produces a
better overall agent.</p><p>However, there are important details in the variations of the different algorithmic components
that merit a more thorough investigation. An important finding of our work is that distributional
RL, when added on its own to DQN, may actually hurt performance. Our investigation suggests
that its true benefits come when combined with another algorithmic component (in the classic
control environments) or when used on a convolutional neural network (as in the MinAtar games).
Investigating these interactions further will lead to a better understanding of distributional RL.</p><h2 id=beyond-the-rainbow>Beyond the Rainbow</h2><p>We leverage the low cost of the small-scale environments to conduct a more thorough
investigation into some of the algorithmic components studied above.</p><h3 id=network-architectures--batch-sizes>Network architectures & batch sizes</h3><p>We investigated the interaction of the best per-game hyperparameters with the number of layers and units per layer.</p><p>The plot below presents the results for DQN:</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/revisiting_rainbow/netArchDQN.png alt="Network architectures, DQN"><p>And the following plot displays the results for Rainbow:</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/revisiting_rainbow/netArchRainbow.png alt="Network architectures, Rainbow"><p>We found that in general using 2-3 layers with at least 256 units each yielded
the best performance. Further, aside from Cartpole, the algorithms were
generally robust to varying network architecture dimensions.</p><p>Another often overlooked hyper-parameter in training RL
agents is the batch size. We investigated the sensitivity of
DQN (top) and Rainbow (bottom) to varying batch sizes and found that
while for DQN it is sub-optimal to use a batch size below
64, Rainbow seems fairly robust to both small and large
batch sizes.</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/revisiting_rainbow/batchSizes.png alt="Batch sizes"><h3 id=distribution-parameterizations>Distribution parameterizations</h3><p>Although distributional RL is an important component of the Rainbow agent, at the time of its development Rainbow
was only evaluated with the C51 parameterization of the distribution, as originally proposed by Bellemare et al. (2017).
Since then there have been a few new proposals for parameterizing the return distribution, notably
<a href=https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/viewFile/17184/16590>quantile regression</a>
and <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06923>implicit quantile networks (IQN)</a>.</p><p>We evaluated modified versions of the Rainbow agent, where the distribution is parameterized using either QR-DQN or IQN.</p><h4 id=qr-dqn>QR-DQN</h4><p>In the figure below, we evaluate the interaction of the different Rainbow
components with Quantile and find that, in general, QR-DQN responds favourably
when augmented with each of the components. We also evaluate a new agent,
QRainbow, which is the same as Rainbow but with the QR-DQN parameterization. It
is interesting to observe that in the classic control environments Rainbow
outperforms QRainbow, but QRainbow tends to perform better than Rainbow on
Minatar (with the notable exception of Freeway), suggesting that perhaps the
quantile parameterization of the return distribution has greater benefits when
used with networks that include convolutional layers.</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/revisiting_rainbow/qrDQN.png alt=QR-DQN><h4 id=iqn>IQN</h4><p>In contrast to QR-DQN, in the classic control environments the effect on
performance of various Rainbow components is rather mixed and, as with QR-DQN
IRainbow underperforms Rainbow. In Minatar we observe a similar trend as with
QR-DQN: IRainbow outperforms Rainbow on all the games except Freeway.</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/revisiting_rainbow/IQN.png alt=IQN><h3 id=munchausen-rl>Munchausen RL</h3><p><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14430>Vieillard et al. (2020)</a> introduced Munchausen RL as a
simple variant to any temporal difference learning agent
consisting of two main components: the use of stochastic
policies and augmenting the reward with the scaled logpolicy. Integrating their proposal to DQN yields M-DQN
with performance superior to that of C51; the integration of
Munchausen-RL to IQN produced M-IQN, a new state-ofthe art agent on the ALE.</p><p>In the figure below we report the results when repeating the Rainbow experiment
on M-DQN and M-IQN. In the classic control environments neither of the
Munchausen variants seem to yield much of an improvement over their base
agents. In Minatar, while M-DQN does seem to improve over DQN, the same cannot
be said of M-IQN. We explored combining all the Rainbow components with the
Munchausen agents and found that, in the classic control environments, while
M-Rainbow underperforms relative to its non-Munchausen counterpart, M-IRainbow
can provide gains. In Minatar, the results vary from game to game, but it
appears that the Munchausen agents yield an advantage on the same games
(Asterix, Breakout, and SpaceInvaders).</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/revisiting_rainbow/munchausen.png alt="Munchausen RL"><h3 id=reevaluating-the-huber-loss>Reevaluating the Huber loss</h3><p>The Huber loss is what is usually used to train DQN agents as it is meant to be
less sensitive to outliers. Based on recent anecdotal evidence, we decided to
evaluate training DQN using the mean-squared error (MSE) loss and found the
surprising result that on all environments considered using the MSE loss
yielded much better results than using the Huber loss, sometimes even
surpassing the performance of the full Rainbow agent (full classic control and
Minatar results are provided in the appendix). This begs the question as to
whether the Huber loss is truly the best loss to use for DQN, especially
considering that reward clipping is typically used for most ALE experiments,
mitigating the occurence of outlier observations. Given that we used <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980>Adam</a> for
all our experiments while the original DQN algorithm used RMSProp, it is
important to consider the choice of optimizer in answering this question.</p><p>To obtain an answer, we compared the performance of the Huber versus the MSE
loss when used with both the Adam and RMSProp optimizers on all 60 Atari 2600
games. We find that, overwhelmingly, Adam+MSE is a superior combination than
RMSProp+Huber.</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/revisiting_rainbow/adamMSE.png alt="Adam+MSE vs RMSProp+Huber"><p>Additionally, when comparing the various optimizer-loss combinations we find that,
when using RMSProp, the Huber loss tends to perform betterthan MSE, which in retrospect explains why Mnih et al.
chose the Huber over the simpler MSE loss when introducing DQN.</p><p>Our findings highlight the importance in properly evaluating
the interaction of the various components used when training
RL agents, as was also argued by <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06049>Fujimoto et al. (2020)</a> with
regards to loss functions and non-uniform sampling from
the replay buffer; as well as by <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02908>Hessel et al. (2019)</a> with
regards to inductive biases used in training RL agents.</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/revisiting_rainbow/lossOptim.png alt="Loss-Optimizer curves"><p>Finally, we note that the <a href=https://google.github.io/dopamine/baselines/plots.html>Dopamine baseline plots</a> now contain
DQN with Adam and MSE as one of the included baselines.</p><h2 id=rainbow-flavours>Rainbow flavours</h2><p>We compare the performance of DQN against all of the Rainbow variants and show
the results below. This figure highlight the
fact that, although Rainbow does outperform DQN, there are important
differences amongst the various flavours that invite further investigation.</p><img src=/posts/research/rl/revisiting_rainbow/flavours.png alt="Rainbow Flavours"><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>On a limited computational budget we were able to reproduce, at a high-level, the findings of
<a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298>Hessel et al. [2018]</a> and uncover new and interesting phenomena. Evidently it is much easier to revisit
something than to discover it in the first place. However, our intent with this work was to argue for
the relevance and significance of empirical research on small- and medium-scale environments. We
believe that these less computationally intensive environments lend themselves well to a more critical
and thorough analysis of the performance, behaviours, and intricacies of new algorithms.</p><p>It is worth remarking that when we initially ran
10 independent trials for the classic control environments, the confidence intervals were very wide
and inconclusive; boosting the independent trials to 100 gave us tighter confidence intervals with
small amounts of extra compute. This would be impractical for most large-scale environments.</p><p>We are by no means calling for less emphasis to be placed on large-scale benchmarks. We are simply
urging researchers to consider smaller-scale environments as a valuable tool in their investigations,
and reviewers to avoid dismissing empirical work that focuses on these smaller problems. By doing
so, we believe, we will get both a clearer picture of the research landscape and will reduce the barriers
for newcomers from diverse, and often underprivileged, communities. These two points can only
help make our community and our scientific advances stronger.</p><h2 id=acknowledgements>Acknowledgements</h2><p>The authors would like to thank Marlos C. Machado, Sara
