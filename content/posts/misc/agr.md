We (well, I) introduce a New Field In Science which we (I mean I) call Artificial General Relativity. We
(here I really mean "we") have all heard of General Relativity and how it revolutionized our understanding of
the world around us. Einstein's work, although pivotal, failed in one crucial aspect: although it allowed us to
describe gravity and spacetime, it did not allow us to control them. In this paper I (switching to "I" to avoid
sounding pretentious with "we") introduce Artificial General Relativity (AGR) which, when achieved, will
allow us to control gravity and spacetime. I present a set of practical approaches to achieve AGR which serve
as reasonable baselines for future work.

You can find the open-source code accompanying this paper [here](https://github.com/psc-g/psc-g.github.io/blob/master/assets/CAFE.ipynb).
This code was used for the experimental evaluations for the CAstro Field Equations (CAFE) introduced in the paper:

I am thrilled to announce this groundbreaking article has been accepted at the competitive, peer-reviewed,
SigBovik 2020 conference (proceedings [here](http://sigbovik.org/2020/proceedings.pdf)).
