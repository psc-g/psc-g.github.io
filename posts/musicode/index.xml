The story I had it in my head that the third episode would talk about variables in the section about Computer Science. Originally I thought the musical would be about chords, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t quite fit well with variables. Then I thought about key signatures, thinking that these are kind of like variables in the sense that you can shift any song into different pitches just by changing key signatures; but again, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t very content with the connection.</description></item><item><title>Episode 2: Bits &amp; Semitones</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/musicode/episode2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2021 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/musicode/episode2/</guid><description>The code for this episode is available here.
The story The idea for doing something with bits seemed kind of natural to me as a second episode. After covering what &amp;ldquo;computation&amp;rdquo; is, why not cover what computers actually &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; when they run computations?
Given that bits are what makes up everything inside a computer&amp;rsquo;s software, I wanted a musical topic that was inside every type of music (at least in Western music).</description></item><item><title>Episode 1: Musical Notes &amp; Computation</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/musicode/episode1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/musicode/episode1/</guid><description>The code for this episode is available here.
The story I originally thought this channel would be a kind of educational channel, where people could learn about both music and computer science in a fun and informal way. I tweeted asking for suggestions for what to cover first on the CS side, and Kory Mathewson&amp;rsquo;s response was my favourite.
On the music side, it was kind of a train-of-thought process.</description></item><item><title>Introducing MUSICODE</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/musicode/introducing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jan 2021 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/musicode/introducing/</guid><description>A musical ode to musical code.

Each episode will explore a topic in Computer Science, a topic in Music, and combine them in creative ways.
You can find the code I use for each episode here!
The story The reason I decided to start this show was because, thanks to COVID-19, I was no longer performing live with my jazz trio, but I was aching for some type of performative output.</description></item></channel></rss>
